==================================================================

The goal of this project is to generate a single data set 
containing both the training and the testing data, reduced to the 
rows to a single observation of user-activity and retaining only 
the columns pertaining to means or standard deviations of the 
features. 

Tidy data is a structure of data that is designed to provide a 
standardized way of linking the structure of a dataset to its 
meaning, as defined within the tidyr package. In tidy data: 

	1. Each variable forms a column. 
	2. Each observation forms a row. 
	3. Each observational unit forms a table. 

In the original project, the main inconsistency with respect to 
the tidy data framework is that there are multiple observations per 
user-activity, e.g. numerous rows of User 1's observed WALKING 
activity. To tidy the data, the data will be merged into a single 
row for each user/activity, with each row representing the mean 
of the observations for that user. 

Each record contains: 
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 79-feature vector with the mean of time and frequency domain variables across that activity. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each row is a mean of the feature vectors for an individual's observation for the given activity.
