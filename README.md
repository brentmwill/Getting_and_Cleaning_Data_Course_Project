# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This project uses data from the Human Activity Recognition dataset to demonstrate several aspects of getting and cleaning data, to ensure that it matches the Tidy format. Four files are included here. 

1. READ ME.txt : a text file which discusses the resulting data set and the methodology used to create the original data. 
2. features.txt : a text file which includes the modified names of the columns. 
3. features_info.txt : a text file which describes the original methodology, updated to refect the modified variable names, and with the addition of information to describe the methodology that was used in tidying the data. 
4. run_analysis.R : a script which modifies the original dataset and produces a resulting tidy dataset.
