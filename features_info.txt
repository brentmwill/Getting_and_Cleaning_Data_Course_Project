Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals time.Acc-XYZ and time.Gyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using 
a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the 
acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (time.BodyAcc-XYZ and time.GravityAcc-XYZ) using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(time.BodyAccJerk-XYZ and time.BodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the 
Euclidean norm (time.BodyAccMag, time.GravityAccMag, time.BodyAccJerkMag, time.BodyGyroMag, time.BodyGyroJerkMag). 

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freq.BodyAcc-XYZ, 
freq.BodyAccJerk-XYZ, freq.BodyGyro-XYZ, freq.BodyAccJerkMag, freq.BodyGyroMag, freq.BodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'freq.' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

The training and testing data originally provided were combined to produce a single combined data frame. Additionally, the 
activity.names and subject identifying variables were preprended to the front of the dataset. Only variables measuring 
either the mean or the standard deviations of the feature vectors were preserved, while the others were excluded from 
further cleaning. Once the combined dataset was completed, the rows were converted, such that they reflect the means 
of the individual's observed feature vectors for the given activity. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
